title: Being Realistic
---

After a few weeks of trying to keep steady at the plans I set forward for myself, I had the weekend to get away and reflect on how everything was going. For the most part, things are alright. I've been using [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to practice general programming by completing problems every night. While I've primarily been using Python 3 it has helped to quickly ungrease those wheels. My job search has been slow and unsuccessful so far, but I haven't given up hope. I'm off the team, and excited for what awaits me going forward.

## The Change

I did, however, need to make a rather large to the roadmap I created previously in completely removing the *Game Design* section. Looking on it, I realized I had once again bitten off more than I could chew. In order for me to successfully achieve whatever I'm going for there, it's probably best to not set such strict guidelines.

I do this for a number of reasons, which I write here so as to remind myself in the future.

### This is not my livelihood.

Unlike the designers I admire, this is not my full time job. There are plenty of other effors that I need to more firmly focus on that will better me career-wise. While I wish this could be my job, this will in no way guarantee the income necessary to substantiate itself.

Like the point above, I do not have time in the week to split my attention between so many objectives that I should expect to make reasonable progress in all of them. Neither do I have the money or material to support this at the moment.

### I can't continue to fail at this.

I have a history of starting projects and biting off more than I can chew. It happened previously with film making. It happened again with animation, with art projects, programming efforts.. I have an idea, I'm passionate, but either for personal shortcomings or external barriers I end up failing and taking everyone down with me.

When I first took on tabletop game design and publishing it was a full-blown effort to give myself something to focus on as my physical and mental health was slipping away. I'd just gotten myself back on track and in the best condition in my life, but in my need to get a job out of college I took the first I could find, and it was horrible. While I tried to get away from it and make something of myself through game design, it didn't help and may have even compounded the issue. I drank as I designed, and the more I wanted to design games the more I drank.

I did manage to make progress here and there. I invested a lot of time into some ideas I would still like to make happen.

However, I managed to pull others into the sinking ship that was my dream. Some people are undoubtedly upset with me. Others, close friends, understood. Either way, I can't really forgive myself for everthing.

**All I can hope to do is recognize when I'm doing it, and stop myself.**

## What This Means

Going forward I'm still going to work on game design, and I'm going to document it here. I have a solid idea that I would like to explore for a tile-based game but it does require a fair bit of research. I'm going to take this a step at a time, and let it take as long as it needs so that I can focus on it and give it the best treatment I can. If and when I need to publish, I'll explore my options then.

I might still look at re-incorporating the LLC and getting the site up and going again, but it'll be a separate effort for later.

## In Conclusion

That's all I have for tonight. Going forward with this blog I have some ideas for regular articles I'd like to write as I learn, for myself and whoever stumbles across them. I'll cover those tomorrow.

For now, goodnight.
