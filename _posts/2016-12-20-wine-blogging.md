I've had a productive day and a glass of wine, so it's time to reflect.


## The Past Few Days

I've actually been pretty busy the past few days, but I've been good about getting programming in. I went ahead with the [Sublime Text plugin](https://github.com/Bunne/GitSummary) for generating git commit update pages in Markdown. It's been a few years since I last made a Sublime Text plugin so it did take a while to get the ball rolling. Mine certainly isn't as complex as a lot of the plugins I studied as reference though. Still, I'm happy with it: it really streamlines the process, especially when paired with the [Git](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git) plugin. I can generate the page and push it all in a minute.

##### TODO

* **Plugin**: Quick-Push support for updating the page. Generate/Commit/Push all with one command. Potentially, Quick-Push as separate plugin.
* **Plugin**: Auto-sort: order lists by commit time. Most recent at top.
* **Github.io**: Add third collumn to the front page to present the page.
* **Other**: A hook that updates the page on-push for registered repos.

## The Next Few Days

Chrimbus is fast approaching and we'll be hosting a close friend for the next month, so I might find it difficult to keep as productive as I have been recently. I'll push through, though.

Apart from the daily job hunt I plan to start work on a larger, two-part project: a Board Game Geek C# API, and a desktop client implementation. I've seen a few implementations of the BGG API in various languages; however, there isn't anything complete or maintained that I've noticed, especially in C#. I'm excited to get to work on it, and have actually spent part of today studying the [BGG XML API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) and how to [parse it in C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh534080.aspx). Of course, I have a lot of work ahead of me, but I think it'll definitely be an interesting experience.
