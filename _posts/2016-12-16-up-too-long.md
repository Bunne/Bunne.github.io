I'm trying to figure out where to go from here.

### Where I Am

I finished my C# project, it's over on [GitHub](https://github.com/Bunne/Progressor) now. It's a simple little thing that I'd like to make simpler. It lets you maintain Task lists via the command line and serializes them for access and manipulation later. What I'm happiest with is the generation of lists from local GitHub repos. All it does is take the latest entries from the commit logs and writes them to a Markdown document. It's simple, but it [looks alright](https://bunne.github.io/progress/) and I'd like to pull it out and make something better of it.

Ideas:

* A plugin for Sublime Text that generates the Markdown document.
* A stand-alone program that generates the document.
* Automatic commit/push of documents to github

I'm leaning towards the Sublime Text plugin but that requires figuring out a whole new API that I am way too exhausted for at this point.

As of now, I've been up since 9AM yesterday. It's 11:40 now so that's about 27 hours and counting. But it's been good for me I suppose, this is the first time since college I've stayed up so long simply because I've been so pre-occupied with development. It feels strangly fulfilling.

I tried picking up Objective-C this morning so I could have a chance at developing a MacDown and gave up pretty quickly. Too much for so little brainpower.

I suppose I should take a break. After coffee I'll get what household chores I need to do finished, and relax. I'll probably be updating this document throughout the day, but when I wake up tomorrow I can focus better on where to go from here.

### Where To Go

* The aforementioned Sublime Text Plugin
* Cleaning up Github.io site; for myself if nothing else
* Re-implement python list comprehensions in C#?
* Telegram bot
* Implement a tabletop game I own (C# probably)
	* Jarl
* Something to monitor my excessive caffeine consumption
	* Coffee social networking?
	* Model after Untappd; I like that app
* More creative writing
	* Unity framework for [Ink](www.inklestudios.com/ink/) games.
	* Write more myself; I need to stop stopping
	* Blogging more is a good start, too
* Board Game Geek game analysis
	* Trends in the industry
	* Games being released/played
