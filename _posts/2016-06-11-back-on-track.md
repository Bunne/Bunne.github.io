title: Back on Track
---

I'm writing all this down as a way of keeping myself focused on my work for once.

It's been about a year and a half since I've had a working computer, one capable enough of doing any sort of real development work. Since then, my involvement in anything remotely technology-related has been confined to efforts at my day job. That work is, at best, unintersting and involves zero software development. As a result, a majority of my time went into studying intelligence theory, game design, and a hefty amount of drinking.

In the past few months, I've moved from D.C. to Chicago to settle in with my partner and our three dwarf rabbits. Here, I finally have an office and a working computer: a really Mid-2015 MacBook Pro.

With these changes I'm doing my best to better myself and get back on track doing what I love: programming and AI.

## Reading Time
I've been working on getting through a number of books.. I plan to write on them when I finish.

* [How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed](https://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/1491518839) - Ray Kurzweil 
* [The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology](https://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Near-Humans-Transcend-Biology/dp/0143037889?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0) -  Ray Kurzweil 
* [On Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533) - Jeff Hawkins 

## Projects
Of course I can't just focus on one effort so I'll be jumping back and forth on a few.

* [BIND: A Virtual World Research Engine](https://github.com/Bunne/Bind) - Python  
The BIND project is still in its infancy; I started it over two years ago as a means to continue working on AI systems after my departure from the research lab. Unfortunately, with the start of work and the loss of my computer not much progress has been made.  
The original goal of the system was to be a text-based natural language game engine, but I've since re-focused the effort.
* [PAR: Parameterized Action Representation](https://github.com/Bunne/PAR) - Python/C++  
The PAR system was one that I worked with during my time in college. At the time, it was integrated into a much larger virtual world system and facilitated the action of agents within it. Right now, I just need to make it run cross-platform; the fact that it only runs on Windows is extremely limiting.
* Undecided Game Project - ???  
I'm not sure what it'll be right now, tabletop or computer, but I need something fun to work on too. It'll probably be an excuse to play with specific AI implementations.

## Language Review
While I'm in the process of recovering my Java/Python/C++ knowledge after a year and a half of inactivity I figured I would take the opportunity to learn new languages too. I still love functional programming; the problem is deciding which direction to go. I'm stuck between Haskell and CLisp; Erlang and Clojure are also options. We'll see where things go. I'd like to be able to utilize functional programming for AI and integrate it into a larger system built on C or Python.
