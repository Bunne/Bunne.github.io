I need to work out how I'm going to brush up on my Python.

### Where I Am

Up until about a month and a half back when I picked up C#, I used Python on a regular, almost daily basis. It was the first language I picked up six years ago and it remains my favorite. So this is less a review and more an expansion of skills and a chance to pick up things I never did before.

### What to Study

* Networking
* SQL/NoSQL
* Data analysis (NumPy)
* Data visualization
* Multi-threading
* OpenCV (for fun)

### Where To Go

A cut down and fixed up version of my previous list.

* Telegram bot
* Design a game
* Implement a tabletop game I own
    * Jarl
* Implement a visual overlay for a game (OpenCV)
    * Jarl
    * MTG
    * Manhattan Project
    * Time Management
    * OGRE
* Board Game Geek game analysis
    * Trends in the industry
    * Games being released/played
* Activity planner
    * Use Yelp API to plot out maps
* More creative writing
    * Write more myself; I need to stop stopping
    * Blogging more is a good start, too
