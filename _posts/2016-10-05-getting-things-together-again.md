title: Getting Things Together Again
---

Things don't seem to stay together long over here. The past few months have been a whirlwind of anxiety and excitement. Because of my working situation, I'll be out of a job in the next few months. At the same time though, my partner is finally starting the job they've always wanted.

Good stuff.

I'm excited; because of all this I finally have an inescapable excuse to restart and focus on bettering myself again. I've tried it before, plenty of times, but I've never been good about keeping to it. Hopefully this time will be different.

After thinking about it for a while I've found the problem is that I always attempt a bottom-up approach; I set goals for each day starting where I am at the time and ending where I want to be. However, if I end up missing a day of this I break down, and so does the whole rest of the plan. I give up.

What I need to do is come up with a top-down approach; starting with where I want to be after a certain length of time, I bisect that timeline further and further until I've got a clear path with milestones. That way, even if I miss a day or week of what I had planned, the end goal is still fixed there in the future.

There are four areas I want to focus on improving right now, I will most likely add more in the future but I'm going to keep it simple for now.

- Reading
- Technology
- Game Design 
- Career

## Reading

My primary goal is to finish a book a month. I'll be forcing myself to read a little every day, but one a month is a good starting point I think.

I'm still reading a few books that I've been having trouble finding the time to finish. I've also added a few to the list. 

- **Month 1**: [Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) - Philip K. Dick
- **Month 2**: [On Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Jeff-Hawkins/dp/0805078533) - Jeff Hawkins 
- **Month 3**: [How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed](https://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/1491518839) - Ray Kurzweil 
- **Month 4**: [The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology](https://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Near-Humans-Transcend-Biology/dp/0143037889?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0) -  Ray Kurzweil 
- **Month 5**: [The Colour of Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colour_of_Magic) - Terry Pratchett


## Technology
I know I'm not as behind in the computer science field as I think I am. Certainly, if I jumped headlong back into research I'd need to do quite a bit of reading to catch up. But on a larger scale, things haven't rushed forward that much. I need to refresh my programming skills, but that's all just like riding a bike. It took me no time to get my current setup all prepared, now I just need to get started[^programming-length].

- **Six Months**: Be working regularly on software development, either through personal or external projects.
	- **Week Four**: Find a project. Plan a contribution. Start on it.
	- **Week Two**: Explore open source projects on Github.
- **Five Months**: Be refreshed on all programming languages. 
- **Five Months**: Final review. Extend knowledge.
	- **Week Four**: Ruby/Lisp
	- **Week Three**: C/C++
	- **Week Two**: Java
	- **Week One**: Python
- **Four Months**: Ruby/Lisp
	- **Week Four**: Finish personal project. Wrap-up and review.
	- **Week Two**: Design small, personal project. Skeleton code.
	- **Week One**: Initial Study. Review past work.
- **Three Months**: C/C++ refreshed.
	- **Week Four**: Finish personal project. Wrap-up and review.
	- **Week Two**: Design small, personal project. Skeleton code.
	- **Week One**: Initial Study. Review past work.
- **Two Months**: Java refreshed.
	- **Week Four**: Finish personal project. Wrap-up and review.
	- **Week Two**: Design small, personal project. Skeleton code.
	- **Week One**: Initial Study. Review past work.
- **One Month**: Python refreshed.
	- **Week Four**: Finish personal project. Wrap-up and review.
	- **Week Two**: Design small, personal project. Skeleton code.
	- **Week One**: Initial Study. Review past work.

And for additional measure:

- **Weekly**: Complete two programming challenges.

## Game Design

For the love of God, I've spent nearly two years on these endeavours, I need to follow through with at least one.

- **Two Years**: Complete publishing a tabletop game.
- **15 Months**: Begin production.
- **14 Months**: Begin crowdfunding[^crowdfunding].
- **13 Months**: Begin promotion.
- **One Year**: Start work on final design.
- **Seven Months**: Complete Playtesting[^playtesting].
- **Three Months**: Begin Playtesting. Continually revise.
- **Two Months**: Prototype each design.
- **Two Months**: Re-start Electric Rabbit LLC.
- **One Month**: Finalize one or two concepts.


## Career

I'm in this one for the long-run. Not sure how to break this down so I'm just keeping them at a high-level.

- **Five Years**: Lead development position.
- **One Year**: Maintain a development position. 
- **Seven Weeks**: Find a new job in Chicago. 


## Closing

Now, I need to set up a calendar to keep myself working on a daily basis.


[^programming-length]: I know this is long and repetitive; I'm keeping it this way so that I can cross things off for each month.
[^crowdfunding]: Unless taking another approach for self-publication. In this case, re-plan early.
[^playtesting]: May or may not happen on time. Can't rush this. The important part is to get the game as good as possible.
