title: Jumping Into Java
---

I realized recently just how out of touch I was with Java. I thought I had the hang of it, but kept tripping up during a technical interview. As a result, I have decided that until I get work, everything I do will be in Java to properly train myself for the position.

Tonight, I got things going by writing a quick abstract card system and built a game of Blackjack off it. I'm going to use it to build various small games to cover different areas including [sorting algorithms](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Sorting_Algorithms) and multithreading. I've listed the most important of the former below, the latter I have previous projects to review that will help.

##### Sorting Algs

* Bubble sort
* Circle sort
* Cocktail sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quicksort
* Selection sort

##### New Technology

I'll also be giving myself a crash course in [Spring](http://spring.io/), and possibly [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/). A review of SQL is necessary, as is some introduction to NoSQL. I'll be using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) respectively. Hopefully at some point I can become certified in them (Spring, at the least).

While I'm at it tonight, I might as well get going on those sorting algs. I'll make a point of documenting my study as I go.
