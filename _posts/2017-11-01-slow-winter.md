The past few weeks have been slow. I figured it was time for an update anyways.

I've had my best friend visiting for about a month now so beyond the regular job hunt my focus has been primarily on enjoying our time together.

I've been gradually working on the BGG API C# Portable Class Library, getting familiar with BGG's XML endpoint and more of the .NET framework, or at least the subset a PCL allows me to deal with. I think it's good though: I learn how to complete certain operations one way, then need to work to figure out how to do it the platform-agnostic way. It's a slow and involved process and I enjoy it immensely.

I still need to focus on getting LINQ down, I just haven't had an excuse to use it. Maybe if I do something more database-oriented, or when I get into the actual parsing of the REST service.

I also need to start getting more up to speed with Python; I'm finding more and more jobs in the city for it so I should split my focus between it and C#. Maybe there's a way I can mix the two.
