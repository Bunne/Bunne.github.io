The past few weeks have been slow. I figured it was time for an update anyways.

I've had my best friend visiting for about a month now so beyond the regular job hunt my focus has been primarily on enjoying our time together.

I've been gradually working on the BGG API C# Portable Class Library, getting familiar with BGG's XML endpoint and more of the .NET framework, or at least the subset a PCL allows me to deal with. I think it's good though: I learn how to complete certain operations one way, then need to work to figure out how to do it the platform-agnostic way. It's a slow and involved process and I enjoy it immensely.

I still need to focus on getting LINQ down, I just haven't had an excuse to use it. Maybe if I do something more database-oriented, or when I get into the actual parsing of the REST service.

I also need to start getting more up to speed with Python; I'm finding more and more jobs in the city for it so I should split my focus between it and C#. Maybe there's a way I can mix the two.


## Post: Part 2

After a decent amount of sleep, a productive day, and plenty of coffee, I can take a look at this post when I'm not on the verge of passing out.

I definitely need to focus more time on Python, more jobs seem to be opening up requiring it, which is nice. I'm pretty comfortable sticking with C# and Python for now because it feels like I can easily springboard from either language to whatever is required of me (Java from C#, Ruby from Python). The hard part is just finding a project using Python that's appropriate and keeps me busy. Maybe I'll do something AI related, or I'll look back on that list I made earlier and pick one.

In any case I'll have something by the end of the night and a schedule for working on it drawn up. As I've got some potential interviews for Python positions coming up, it's a priority.
