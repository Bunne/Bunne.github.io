title: Rethinking Programming Goals
---

Things have been going well as far as keeping to my *Reading* goals. I've picked up different books, but am enjoying going through them. The *Career* goals haven't changed. The job search is moving along, I have some interviews lined up and it's looking promising.

I'm rewriting my tech goals. Programming has been going smoothly and I'm picking things up again quicker than I thought. Of course I've been doing most everything in Python but it's what I love. I'll probably jump back to Java tonight to really push forward on it.

That being said, I'm scrapping my previous goals and I'm going to try hard to focus on a new set. I need to build back up my algorithm knowledge and to do that I'm going to focus on picking one or two a week and programming them out. I don't know which algorithms yet, or what order I'll take, but I like the prospect.

Once I find it again, I'll need to go through my favorite book: [Essentials of Metaheuristics](http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/). It's something I've held onto since college and have enjoyed going through from time to time. It also helps that the author was one of my favorite professors during my stay.

That's all for now!
