Programmer working from a couch in Chicago. Most of my work used to revolve around artificial intelligence and virtual human system development. Nowadays I'm keeping busy until either the chance to get back into the field presents itself or I force my way back. I'm actively working on the latter.

My favorite language is Python, but I also work in Java, C++, and in CLISP (when I can).

This is mostly a personal blog for keeping track of my goals and progress. There will also be a lot of notes documenting what I learn as I learn; this gives me something to work on to make the process easier, and the notes both help drive in concepts as well as give me something to look back on later.

I also have four rabbits: three related polish dwarves and one regular sized bun.

* Dancer (mama bun)
* Blitzen (middle child)
* Donner (baby of the litter)
* Cinnamon (the cuddly one)
